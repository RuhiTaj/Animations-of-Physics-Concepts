# Animations-of-Physics-Concepts
Hai friends!
I have uploaded some of my animations, Iam plannig on uploading to upload all of them soon!

On clicking the link under the name of a particular animation, you are directed to the page, where the animation can viewed.
The corresponding code is available in the code to a 'particular animation' folder.

The PIE folder and the code to 'x' folders should be brother folders to each other and in the 'code to 'x' ' directory.
The index.html in the 'code to 'x' ' directory, can be opened with any browser, preferably firefox!
The working model of the animation is thus set!
