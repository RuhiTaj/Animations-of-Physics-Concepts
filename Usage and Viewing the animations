# Animations-of-Physics-Concepts
Hai friends!
I have uploaded some of my animations, Iam plannig on uploading to upload all of them soon!

On clicking the link under the name of a particular animation, you are directed to the page, where the animation can viewed.
The corresponding code is available in the 'particular animation' folder.

The PIE folder and the animation folders should be brother folders to each other and in the animation ' directory.
The index.html in the animation directory, can be opened with any browser, preferably firefox!
The working model of the animation is thus set!
